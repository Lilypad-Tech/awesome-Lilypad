# awesome-Lilypad - examples, use cases, and more!

Lilypad is developing a serverless, distributed compute network that enables internet-scale data processing, AI, ML & other arbitrary computation from blockchains, while unleashing idle processing power & unlocking a new marketplace for compute.

Lilypad provides decentralized AI computational services. By extending unrestricted, global access to computational power, Lilypad strategically collaborates with decentralized infrastructure networks, such as Filecoin, to formulate a transparent, efficient, and accessible computational ecosystem. Perform off-chain decentralized compute over data, with on-chain guarantees, and to call this functionality directly from a smart contract, CLI and an easy to use abstraction layer, opens the door to a multitude of possible applications.

## Examples
- [Smart contract jobs](https://github.com/Lilypad-Tech/lilypad/blob/main/docs/smart-contract-jobs.md) - Trigger jobs on the Lilypad network from a smart contract
- [Run Lilypad on a client](https://blog.lilypadnetwork.org/setting-up-your-lilypad-front-end) - Integrate Lilypad into a frontend to run a SDXL module to generate images
